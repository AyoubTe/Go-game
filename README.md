## About the Project
The Go Game is a strategy board game that originated in ancient China. Our project aims to provide a digital version of the Go game, allowing players to compete against each other online or against an AI opponent. This repository contains the source code and related files for the Go game implementation.

# Simple def of GO game
Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid.

# Goals
- This project is C code of the strategic game GO. 
- We will use 9x9 Go broad.
- The code of programme will automatise the rules and at least 3 TSUME-Go (Tsumego (詰碁) is the Japanese term for a type of go problem based on life-and-death).
- The game will contain to choice of play types: P2P and P v/s M.
- In the context of this project we will have 3 levels of difficulty, which are : easy, medium and hard of user-machine side. 

# Expected Versions
- The first version of the game will be a console game only. 
- Then in the second version we will use SDL library to create a graghic console that helps users to play game more easly and let it more interactive.
